# Contributing to miniBlog

Thanks for wanting to contribute to miniBlog! This project is free and open
source, and contributions are very welcome.

You can help by:

- [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)
- [Writing documentation and contributing source code](#writing-documentation-and-contributing-source-code)

Beforehand, you may also want to read about [copyrights and licenses for contributions](#copyrights-and-licenses-for-contributions).

In any case, please:

- **Read** the [code of conduct](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/django-miniblog/-/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  It's nothing scary.
- [Open an issue on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/django-miniblog/-/issues)
  **before** starting anything new, just to make sure that it is not already a
  work in progress. The project is still very young, there are a lot of
  features already planned and being worked on.
- **Do not** use GitLab Issues for requesting support. After making sure that
  your question is not covered in the documentation, you can send an email at
  help@pascalpepe.com.
- **Be patient** and wait at least a couple of days before sending a follow-up
  email or comment.

## Reporting bugs

First, search [existing issues](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/django-miniblog/-/issues)
to check whether the bug has already been reported.

If that's not the case, open a new issue with:

- [ ] A short and descriptive title.
- [ ] A longer description of the bug.
- [ ] A list of steps required to reproduce the bug.
- [ ] Additional information that might be relevant to the issue being described.

## Writing documentation and contributing source code

First, search [existing issues](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/django-miniblog/-/issues)
and [existing merge requests](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/django-miniblog/-/merge_requests)
to check whether your suggestion is already being worked on.

If that's not the case, please open a new issue with:

- [ ] A short and descriptive title.
- [ ] A longer summary of what you plan on contributing.

After your suggestion is approved, and if you want to work on it yourself:

1. Fork the project on GitLab.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create a new branch dedicated to your work. When naming the branch,
   prefix it with its related issue number. For example:
   ``1234-short-descriptive-name``.
4. Push the branch with your work on your own repository.
5. Open a merge request to the upstream repository. All merge requests must
   target the main branch.
